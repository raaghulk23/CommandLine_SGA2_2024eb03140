Google’s mostly-forgotten Pixel Tablet is getting a new lease on life, as the company is giving its one and 
only tablet another two years of Android OS updates to match the policy on its phones.
With the first few generations of Tensor-powered Pixel devices, Google carried a policy of three years of major 
Android OS updates followed by two additional years of security updates. In 2023, though, 
Google pushed this way out to seven years of both Android OS and security updates on the Pixel eight series, a 
policy that’s continued through newer generations.
